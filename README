For Creation: we have tested the create header function and the create contents function and they 
both work as they should. We both understand how the archive is created, however the problem we have 
been running into is traversing the directory trees. For some reason it traverses the whole tree, 
but when it gets to the text files and gets to our if statment with stat (stat(path, &sb)) it does 
not return zero for somereason.
For Listing: We almost have everything done for the listing. We have finished both normal and 
verbose parts of the listing. The only part we need to deal with is the tests dealing with the prefixes when the
regular name is too long. We understand how it works, we just did not have enough time to implement it
For Extraction: We did not get to this part yet becasue we have been spending all the time 
trying to perfect Creation and Listing. We do understand how extraction works and what we need to do, 
we just need to implement it.
